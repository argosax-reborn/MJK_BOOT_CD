BUILD A BOOTCD TO USE A HOST AS A SLAVE FOR JohnTheRipper on a OpenMPI server.

20 hosts = 20 slaves

Computing time / 20

This repo comes with a french tutorial on http://majestikfortress.com.

The tutorial covers the build of the client AND the server bootcd.

So, if you have plenty of idling hosts nearby, you can make them work for a good cause.

Cluster computing, video rendering, password breaking, and many others.
